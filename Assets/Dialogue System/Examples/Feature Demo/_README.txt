Dialogue System Feature Demo

This folder contains a scene that demonstrates the major features of the Dialogue System.
The dialogue was written in Chat Mapper. A subfolder named "Articy Feature Demo" contains
the same demo written in articy:draft.


The Dialogue Database subfolder contains:

- Feature Demo.cmp: The Chat Mapper project
- Feature Demo.xml: The XML exported from the Chat Mapper project
- Feature Demo.asset: The dialogue database converted from the XML


The Articy Feature Demo subfolder contains:

- Articy Feature Demo scene: Feature Demo scene using using articy:draft
- Articy Feature Demo Project.zip: The articy:draft project
- Articy Feature Demo.xml: The XML exported from the articy:draft project
- Feature Demo dialogue database: Generated using the articy:draft Converter tool


The Top Down Demo subfolder contains an example using ProximitySelector and NavigateOnMouseClick,
demonstrating methods that could be used for isometric/top-down games.

The Menu Text Demo subfolder contains a variation that uses shorter Menu Text paraphrases for
the player response menu. The player's selection is then expanded into the full Dialogue Text.
